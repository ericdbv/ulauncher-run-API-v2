A [ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) extension to run shell commands

# Usage
Type `run` followed by a command

# Note
This is a fork of the **Run** extension by James Dumas for API v1:
[ulauncher-run](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-james-dumas-ulauncher-run)

No modifications were made so far besides adapting the definition files to API v2.
